Description: Maximum likelihood estimators provide a powerful statistical tool. 
  In this paper we directly deal with non-linear reserving models, without the 
  need to transform those models to make them tractable for linear or generalized 
  linear methods. We also show how the same general approach can be easily 
  adapted to provide estimates for a very wide range of reserving methods and 
  models, making use of the same framework, and even much of the same computer 
  code. We focus on the triangle of incremental average costs, and show how five
  common methods can be set in a stochastic framework.
