\title{Create list for Kramer Chain Ladder parmaterization model
g - Assumed loss emergence model, a function of the parameters a.
Note g must be matrix-valued with size rows and size columns
g itself
Basic design is for g to be a function of a single parameter vector, however
in the simulations it is necessary to work on a matrix of parameters, one
row for each simulated parameter, so g_obj must be flexible enough to handle
both.
Here g_obj is nonlinear and based on the Kramer Chain Ladder parmaterization}
\usage{
capecod(B0, paid_to_date, upper_triangle_mask)
}
\arguments{
\item{B0}{development triangle}

\item{paid_to_date}{numeric vector of length \code{size}. It is the lower
 diagnal of
the development triangle in row order. It represents the amount paid to date.}

\item{upper_triangle_mask}{is a mask matrix of allowable data, upper
triangular assuming same
development increments as exposure increments}
