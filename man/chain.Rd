\title{Create list for Cape Cod model}
\usage{
chain(B0, paid_to_date, upper_triangle_mask)
}
\arguments{
\item{B0}{development triangle}

\item{paid_to_date}{numeric vector of length \code{size}. It is the lower diagnal of
the development triangle in row order. It represents the amount paid to date.}

\item{upper_triangle_mask}{is a mask matrix of allowable data, upper triangular assuming same
development increments as exposure increments}
}
\description{
g itself
Basic design is for g to be a function of a single parameter vector, however
in the simulations it is necessary to work on a matrix of parameters, one
row for each simulated parameter, so g_obj must be flexible enough to handle
both.
Here g_obj is a version of the Cape Cod model but with the restriction
that the expected cumulative averge payments to date equal the actual
average paid to date.  Because of this restriction the incremental averages
are expressed as a percentage times the expected ultimate by row.
Formulae all assume a full, square development triangle.
